### Introduction to Using HTML Forms with JSP

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize HTML forms within JSP (JavaServer Pages). The key topics covered include an overview of HTML forms, how to create them, and how to process the form data using JSP. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to build an HTML form that collects student information and processes it with JSP.

### Understanding HTML Forms

HTML forms are a fundamental part of web development. If you've ever logged in to a website using a username and password or booked a flight or hotel online, you've interacted with an HTML form. Forms are used to collect user data, which is then sent to a server for processing.

### Building an HTML Form

Let's start by creating an HTML form designed to collect a student's first and last name. The form will include two text fields and a submit button.

Here's a simple example of an HTML form:

```html
<form action="student-response.jsp" method="post">
    <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName"><br><br>

    <label for="lastName">Last Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="lastName" name="lastName"><br><br>

    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In this form:
- The `form` tag defines the form itself and specifies where to send the data using the `action` attribute. In this case, the form data will be sent to `student-response.jsp` for processing.
- The `input` tags define the fields where users can enter data. The `name` attribute is crucial as it identifies the data fields on the server side.
- The `submit` button sends the form data to the server.

### Processing Form Data with JSP

Once the form is submitted, the data is sent to the `student-response.jsp` page for processing. In JSP, you can access the submitted data using the `request.getParameter()` method.

Here’s an example of how to process the form data:

```jsp
<%
    String firstName = request.getParameter("firstName");
    String lastName = request.getParameter("lastName");
%>

<p>The student is confirmed:</p>
<p>First Name: <%= firstName %></p>
<p>Last Name: <%= lastName %></p>
```

In this JSP snippet:
- `request.getParameter("firstName")` retrieves the value entered in the "firstName" field of the form.
- `request.getParameter("lastName")` retrieves the value from the "lastName" field.
- The retrieved values are then displayed on the confirmation page.

### Alternate Syntax for Displaying Form Data

JSP also offers a shortcut method for displaying form data using the `${param}` syntax. This method is useful for simplifying code when you only need to display form data.

Here’s how you can use it:

```jsp
<p>The student is confirmed:</p>
<p>First Name: ${param.firstName}</p>
<p>Last Name: ${param.lastName}</p>
```

This approach is a more concise way of writing the JSP code. However, note that it’s mainly used for displaying data and not for processing it in scriptlets.

### Conclusion and Next Steps

In this section, we covered the basics of creating an HTML form, capturing data, and processing it using JSP. In the next video, we’ll dive into a live coding demo where we'll implement this code in Eclipse. This will give you hands-on experience in building and processing HTML forms with JSP.
