### Introduction: Understanding JSP Expressions
In this video, we'll explore how to use JSP expressions, one of the key scripting elements in JSP. Before diving into the details, let's briefly introduce the three main types of scripting elements in JSP: JSP expressions, JSP scriptlets, and JSP declarations. Each of these will be covered in depth in separate videos, but today, our focus is on JSP expressions.

### Overview of JSP Scripting Elements
**1. JSP Expressions**:
   - **Definition**: A JSP expression allows you to include a small Java expression directly in your HTML page. The syntax for a JSP expression is `<%= expression %>`.
   - **Purpose**: The result of this expression is automatically converted to a string and included in the HTML output sent to the browser.

**2. JSP Scriptlets**:
   - **Definition**: A JSP scriptlet allows you to include Java code blocks within your JSP page. The syntax is `<% code %>`.
   - **Usage**: You can include one or more lines of Java code, which will be executed on the server side.

**3. JSP Declarations**:
   - **Definition**: A JSP declaration allows you to define Java variables or methods within your JSP page. The syntax is `<%! declaration %>`.
   - **Usage**: This is typically used to define methods or variables that can be reused throughout the JSP page.

### JSP Expressions: A Closer Look
**Definition and Syntax**:
- A JSP expression computes a value and includes the result directly in the HTML output.
- The syntax is `<%= expression %>`, where the `expression` is any valid Java expression.

**Example**: 
Let's revisit an example from our previous video where we displayed the current time on the server:
```html
The time on the server is: <%= new java.util.Date() %>
```
- **Explanation**: In this example, the `new java.util.Date()` expression creates a Date object with the current timestamp. The `toString()` method of the Date object is automatically called, and the result is included in the HTML sent to the browser.

### Using JSP Expressions: Examples
**1. Converting a String to Uppercase**:
   - **Scenario**: You want to convert the string "Hello World" to uppercase and display it on your page.
   - **Code**:
   ```html
   <%= new String("Hello World").toUpperCase() %>
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This code creates a new string "Hello World" and converts it to uppercase using the `toUpperCase()` method. The result, "HELLO WORLD", is then included in the HTML output.

**2. Performing Mathematical Operations**:
   - **Scenario**: You want to calculate the product of 25 and 4 and display the result.
   - **Code**:
   ```html
   25 multiplied by 4 equals <%= 25 * 4 %>
   ```
   - **Explanation**: The expression `25 * 4` evaluates to 100, which is then displayed in the HTML as "25 multiplied by 4 equals 100".

**3. Evaluating Boolean Expressions**:
   - **Scenario**: You want to check if 75 is less than 69 and display the result.
   - **Code**:
   ```html
   Is 75 less than 69? <%= 75 < 69 %>
   ```
   - **Explanation**: The expression `75 < 69` evaluates to `false`, which is then displayed in the HTML as "Is 75 less than 69? false".

### Implementing JSP Expressions in Eclipse
**Step-by-Step Guide**:
1. **Create a New JSP File**:
   - Open your existing project (`jspdemo`) in Eclipse.
   - Navigate to the `WebContent` folder, right-click, and select `New > File`.
   - Name the file `expression-test.jsp` and click `Finish`.

2. **Write the HTML and JSP Code**:
   - Add basic HTML structure with a `<body>` tag.
   - Insert the JSP expressions discussed earlier.

   **Example Code**:
   ```html
   <body>
       Converting a string to uppercase: <%= new String("Hello World").toUpperCase() %><br>
       25 multiplied by 4 equals <%= 25 * 4 %><br>
       Is 75 less than 69? <%= 75 < 69 %>
   </body>
   ```

3. **Run the JSP File**:
   - Right-click on `expression-test.jsp`, select `Run As > Run on Server`.
   - Choose the Tomcat server and click `Finish`.

4. **View the Output**:
   - The results will be displayed in your browser, showing the converted string, the product of the mathematical expression, and the result of the Boolean expression.
